# Water Waves

Water Waves is a simulation of ships transporting packages between cities. The goal of the program is to transport all the required packages to their destinations in the shortest amount of time possible.

## Installation

To run Water Waves, download the Python file and save it on your computer. The program requires Python version 3 or higher.

## Usage

Run the program using the command:

```
python water_waves.py
```

The program reads input from a file called "input.txt" located in the same directory as the Python file. The format of the input file is:

```
<departure_city> <destination_city> <number_of_packages>
```

The departure and destination cities should be one of the following: "BARCELONA", "MARSEILLE", "GENOA", "NAPLES", or "MESSINA". The number of packages should be an integer.

Once the program is running, ships will sail between cities to transport packages. The program will output information about each ship's movements and actions.
